**Explanation**

Below are worked‐through solutions for parts (b) A\* Search and (c) Hill Climbing Search, following the same style as part (a). In particular:

- The **F(n)** tables match the example’s style by listing the Manhattan‐distance heuristic \(\;h(n)=|x_n - x_g| + |y_n - y_g|\;\) in each cell (the same table of numbers as in part (a), because the heuristic itself has not changed).
- Blocked squares are marked with `#`.
- The start position is marked with `S`.
- The goal position is marked with `G`.
- For each algorithm, we also provide the “Search steps and solution path” table, marking the order in which cells are **expanded**, and we highlight the final path discovered (if any).

> **Note:**
>
> - In **A\***, the actual cost function is \(f(n) = g(n) + h(n)\), but in the table below we only display the heuristic \(h(n)\) (just as part (a) only displayed \(h(n)\) even though for Greedy Best‐First, \(f(n)=h(n)\)).
> - For **Hill Climbing**, effectively \(f(n)=h(n)\) again, but it proceeds greedily step by step, often getting stuck in local minima.

## b. A\* Search

### 1. F(n) Table

Because the **heuristic** \(h(n)\) is the same as in part (a), the table of numbers remains the Manhattan distance from each (passable) square to the goal \(G\). We again label blocked squares with `#`, the start with `S`, and the goal with `G`.

|     | 1   | 2   | 3     | 4   | 5   | 6     | 7   | 8   |
| --- | --- | --- | ----- | --- | --- | ----- | --- | --- |
| A   | 3   | 2   | 1     | 2   | 3   | 4     | 5   | 6   |
| B   | 2   | 1   | **G** | 1   | 2   | 3     | 4   | 5   |
| C   | 3   | 2   | 1     | 2   | 3   | 4     | 5   | 6   |
| D   | 4   | 3   | #     | #   | #   | #     | #   | 7   |
| E   | 5   | #   | 3     | 4   | 5   | 6     | 7   | 8   |
| F   | 6   | 5   | #     | 5   | 6   | **S** | #   | 9   |
| G   | 7   | 6   | 5     | 6   | 7   | 8     | 9   | 10  |
| H   | 8   | 7   | 6     | 7   | 8   | 9     | 10  | 11  |

- `S` is at **F6** (row F, column 6).
- `G` is at **B3** (row B, column 3).
- `#` indicates blocked squares (not traversable).
- The numbers elsewhere are the Manhattan distances \(h(n)\) to the goal \((B,3)\).

---

### 2. Search Steps and Solution Path

Below is one consistent way that **A\*** will expand nodes and eventually discover a path around the large block of `#` squares. We label each square in **the order** it is first _taken from the priority queue_ (expanded). Once \(G\) is actually dequeued/expanded, the path is found.

A\* will systematically expand from \(S\), checking neighbors with priority \(f(n)=g(n)+h(n)\). Because of the obstacles, the path must loop around (via row G and then up the left side).

- **Note:** In an actual A\* run, many nodes off‐path get expanded (because they also appear with competitive \(f\)-values).
- The key is that once \(B3\) (the goal) is extracted from the open list, the search terminates.

An example of a final ordering of expansions (one of the straightforward orders) is shown here:

1. **F6** = \(S\)
2. E6
3. F5
4. E5
5. F4
6. E4
7. E3
8. G6
9. G5
10. G4
11. G3
12. G2
13. G1
14. F1
15. E1
16. D1
17. C1
18. B1
19. B2
20. **B3** = \(G\)

We place these numbers in the grid below under “Search steps.” Then we **highlight** the final path that A\* recovers from \(S\) to \(G\). That path (going around the bottom and then up the left) is:

```
F6 -> G6 -> G5 -> G4 -> G3 -> G2 -> G1 ->
F1 -> E1 -> D1 -> C1 -> B1 -> B2 -> B3
```

(This path has length 13 moves.)

Below is the table with expansions labeled and the solution path in bold:

|     | 1   | 2   | 3     | 4   | 5   | 6     | 7   | 8   |
| --- | --- | --- | ----- | --- | --- | ----- | --- | --- |
| A   |     |     |       |     |     |       |     |     |
| B   | 17  | 18  | **G** |     |     |       |     |     |
| C   | 16  |     |       |     |     |       |     |     |
| D   | 15  |     | #     | #   | #   | #     | #   |     |
| E   | 14  | #   | 6     | 5   | 3   | 1     |     |     |
| F   | 13  |     | #     | 4   | 2   | **S** | #   |     |
| G   | 12  | 11  | 10    | 9   | 8   | 7     |     |     |
| H   |     |     |       |     |     |       |     |     |

Cells with bold font (`**...**`) mark the final solution path. Notice we had to circumvent the blocked region in row D and the blocked squares in row E/F.

## c. Hill Climbing Search

### 1. F(n) Table

Hill Climbing again uses the _same_ heuristic function \(h(n)\). As in the other parts, we list the same Manhattan‐distance values or `#`/`S`/`G`:

|     | 1   | 2   | 3     | 4   | 5   | 6     | 7   | 8   |
| --- | --- | --- | ----- | --- | --- | ----- | --- | --- |
| A   | 3   | 2   | 1     | 2   | 3   | 4     | 5   | 6   |
| B   | 2   | 1   | **G** | 1   | 2   | 3     | 4   | 5   |
| C   | 3   | 2   | 1     | 2   | 3   | 4     | 5   | 6   |
| D   | 4   | 3   | #     | #   | #   | #     | #   | 7   |
| E   | 5   | #   | 3     | 4   | 5   | 6     | 7   | 8   |
| F   | 6   | 5   | #     | 5   | 6   | **S** | #   | 9   |
| G   | 7   | 6   | 5     | 6   | 7   | 8     | 9   | 10  |
| H   | 8   | 7   | 6     | 7   | 8   | 9     | 10  | 11  |

### 2. Search Steps and (Lack of) Solution Path

In **Hill Climbing**, we start at \(S\) and repeatedly move to the neighboring square that _best_ _decreases_ the heuristic \(h(n)\). If no neighbor has a lower \(h\) than the current node, the algorithm stops (a local minimum) and fails to find a path if the goal is not yet reached.

Here is what happens step by step:

1. **Expand F6 (S).**

   - Possible moves:
     - Up to E6: \(h=6\)
     - Left to F5: \(h=6\)
     - Down to G6: \(h=8\)
     - Right is blocked
   - The “best” \(h\)-value among neighbors is **6** (tie between E6 and F5). By the tie‐breaking rule (up, left, right, down), we choose **E6** first.

2. **Expand E6.**

   - Neighbors: E5 \((h=5)\), F6 \((h=7)\), D6 is blocked
   - We move to **E5** since \(h=5\) is a decrease from 6.

3. **Expand E5.**

   - Neighbors: E4 \((h=4)\), E6 \((h=6)\), F5 \((h=6)\), D5 is blocked
   - Best is **E4** with \(h=4\).

4. **Expand E4.**

   - Neighbors: E3 \((h=3)\), E5 \((h=5)\), F4 \((h=5)\), D4 is blocked
   - Best is **E3** with \(h=3\).

5. **Expand E3.**
   - Neighbors: E2 (blocked), E4 \((h=4)\), F3 (blocked), D3 (blocked)
   - **All neighbors** are blocked or have higher \(h\)-values than 3.
   - Hill Climbing stops here, since no neighbor is better (lower \(h\)).

Because the goal \(G\) at \((B,3)\) is _not_ reached, **Hill Climbing fails**. We got stuck at **E3** with \(h=3\), unable to improve further but still far from the goal.

We show these expansions (1..5) in the table, and there is no solution path:

|     | 1   | 2   | 3     | 4   | 5   | 6     | 7   | 8   |
| --- | --- | --- | ----- | --- | --- | ----- | --- | --- |
| A   |     |     |       |     |     |       |     |     |
| B   |     |     | **G** |     |     |       |     |     |
| C   |     |     |       |     |     |       |     |     |
| D   |     |     | #     | #   | #   | #     | #   |     |
| E   |     | #   | 4     | 3   | 2   | 1     |     |     |
| F   |     |     | #     |     |     | **S** | #   |     |
| G   |     |     |       |     |     |       |     |     |
| H   |     |     |       |     |     |       |     |     |

Numbering of expansions in that table:

- **1** = \(S\) at **F6**
- **2** = E6
- **3** = E5
- **4** = E4
- **5** = E3 (then stuck)

No solution path is found.
